# A sample Makefile for building both Google Mock and Google Test and
# using them in user tests.  This file is self-contained, so you don't
# need to use the Makefile in Google Test's source tree.  Please tweak
# it to suit your environment and project.  You may want to move it to
# your project's root directory.
#
# SYNOPSIS:
#
#   make [all]  - makes everything.
#   make TARGET - makes the given target.
#   make clean  - removes all files generated by make.

CC = gcc

# Please tweak the following variable definitions as needed by your
# project, except GMOCK_HEADERS and GTEST_HEADERS, which you can use
# in your own targets but shouldn't modify.

# Points to the root of Google Mock, relative to where this file is.
# Remember to tweak this if you move this file.

# Remember to tweak this if you move this file, or if you want to use
# a copy of Google Test at a different location.
